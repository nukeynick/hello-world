Introduction to Git-hub

The purpose of this exercise is to learn the basics of Git-hub's functionality.
So far I have created a repository and learned about brances.
Branches allow me to develop pieces of code without affecting the whole, until I am ready to commit changes.
--As an aside, commit is how changes are implemented to the main branch.
